## üß™ Testing Instructions

### **Step 1: Client Creation Test**

1. **Open the application** (http://localhost:3000)
2. **On Client Information page**, you should see:
   - Client dropdown (empty initially)
   - "New Client" button
   - Client information form
   - "Save Client" button

3. **Fill out the form** with test data:
   ```
   Client Name: Test Company Inc
   Website URL: https://testcompany.com
   Industry: Technology
   Target Audience: Small business owners
   Geographic Targeting: San Francisco, CA
   Unique Selling Points: Fast service, Expert support
   Brand Voice: Professional and friendly
   Call to Action: Get started today
   Budget: 5000
   ```

4. **Click "Save Client"**
   - Should show "Saving..." message
   - Then "Client created successfully!" message
   - Current client indicator should appear
   - Client dropdown should refresh with new client

### **Step 2: Client Selection Test**

1. **Create a second client** by clicking "New Client"
2. **Fill different data** and save
3. **Use the dropdown** to switch between clients
4. **Verify form updates** when selecting different clients

### **Step 3: Campaign Creation Test**

1. **Select a client** from dropdown
2. **Go to Campaign Structure tab**
3. **Click "Add Campaign"**
4. **Create a test campaign** - should work without errors
5. **Verify campaign is linked** to the selected client

### **Step 4: Auto-save Test**

1. **Select a client**
2. **Modify any field** in the client form
3. **Wait 3 seconds** without clicking save
4. **Should see "Auto-saved" message**

### **Step 5: Error Handling Test**

1. **Try to create campaign without selecting client** (should show error)
2. **Try to save client with empty required fields** (should show validation error)
3. **Test with invalid URLs** (should show validation error)

## üîç Expected Database Structure

After testing, your Supabase database should contain:

### **Clients Table**
```
id (uuid) | name | website_url | industry | target_audience | ... | created_at
```

### **Campaigns Table**
```
id (uuid) | client_id (foreign key) | name | is_unit_type | created_at
```

### **Ad Groups Table**
```
id (uuid) | campaign_id (foreign key) | name | theme | is_location_ad_group | created_at
```
