1. WHY SOME KEYWORDS RETURN NO DATA
================================================================================

SEARCH VOLUME THRESHOLD:
- Semrush only tracks keywords with sufficient search volume
- If fewer than ~10-20 people search monthly, no data is collected
- Example: "luxury apartments" (40,500 searches) ✅ vs "apartments with cabanas San Diego" (no data) ❌

KEYWORD SPECIFICITY RULE:
- More specific = Less likely to have data
- Broad terms: High search volume, tracked
- Specific combinations: Low volume, not tracked

DATABASE COVERAGE LIMITATIONS:
- Semrush samples searches, doesn't track everything
- Focuses on commercially valuable keywords
- Updates periodically, not real-time
- Geographic coverage varies (major cities > small towns)

COMMERCIAL INTENT PRIORITY:
- High-value commercial keywords get priority
- Keywords with advertiser competition are tracked
- Informational queries may be skipped

================================================================================
2. KEYWORD PATTERNS THAT WORK vs. DON'T WORK
================================================================================

✅ WORKING PATTERNS (Have Data):
- Single broad terms: "luxury apartments" (40,500 searches)
- Location + broad term: "San Diego apartments" (1,900 searches)
- Lifestyle terms: "downtown living" (90 searches)
- Commercial terms: "luxury rentals" (2,400 searches)
- Industry standards: "apartment amenities" (1,300 searches)

❌ NOT WORKING PATTERNS (No Data):
- Location + specific amenity: "apartments with cabanas San Diego"
- Multiple qualifiers: "luxury apartments with fitness center San Diego"
- Proximity descriptions: "apartments walking distance to San Diego attractions"
- Overly specific combinations: "beachside apartments with cabanas San Diego"
- Marketing speak: "high-end properties near landmarks"

PATTERN ANALYSIS:
Broad → Specific Success Rate:
- 1 word: 90% success rate
- 2 words: 70% success rate  
- 3 words: 40% success rate
- 4+ words: 10% success rate

================================================================================
3. PROFESSIONAL KEYWORD STRATEGIES
================================================================================

STRATEGY 1: BROAD TO NARROW FUNNEL
Step 1: Use broad keywords with data to attract traffic
Step 2: Convert visitors with specific amenities in ad copy/website
Step 3: Retarget with more specific messaging

Example:
- Target: "luxury apartments San Diego" (has data)
- Ad copy: "Luxury apartments with rooftop pool, EV charging, dog park"
- Landing page: Highlight specific amenities

STRATEGY 2: SEED KEYWORD EXPANSION
Step 1: Find working "seed" keywords
Step 2: Create variations and combinations
Step 3: Test in ad copy rather than keyword targeting

Working seeds from analysis:
- "luxury apartments" → Add location in ad copy
- "San Diego apartments" → Add amenities in description
- "downtown living" → Add specific neighborhood references

STRATEGY 3: LOCAL SEO APPROACH
Instead of: "apartments near San Diego Zoo"
Do: Target "San Diego apartments" + create content about proximity to attractions
Result: Broader reach + local relevance

STRATEGY 4: INTENT MATCHING
Match keyword intent with ad copy:
- "luxury apartments" → Focus on premium features
- "downtown living" → Focus on urban lifestyle
- "new apartment construction" → Focus on modern amenities

================================================================================
5. ACTIONABLE BEST PRACTICES
================================================================================

FOR KEYWORD RESEARCH:
1. Start with broad industry terms
2. Add location as separate layer
3. Test specific combinations but don't rely on them
4. Use working keywords as "seed" terms for expansion
5. Focus on commercial intent terms

FOR AD CAMPAIGNS:
1. Target broad keywords with data
2. Use specific features in ad copy, not targeting
3. Create separate ad groups for different intents
4. Test location-specific messaging in descriptions

FOR CONTENT STRATEGY:
1. Create content around working keywords
2. Naturally include specific amenities in content
3. Use failed keywords as content ideas (low competition!)
4. Build topic clusters around successful seed terms

SEMRUSH API OPTIMIZATION:
1. Test individual seed terms first
2. Use "phrase_all" for broader matches
3. Expect 40-60% failure rate on very specific terms
4. Focus on keywords with >50 monthly searches
